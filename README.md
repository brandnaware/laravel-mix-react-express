# laravel-mix-react-express
A boilerplate for Express with react packed with laravel mix.

This is a simple boilerplate you can use to run express server with react or vue in the front using [laravel-mix](https://laravel-mix.com/) as a packager.

With this you can leverage on the power bestowed on laravel.

Good thing is that unlike create react app, where you cannot have multiple entry point, with this setup you can create multiple SPA and set it up however you like. 

Small setup footprint with no webpack configuration and knowledge.
